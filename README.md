I'm a "programmer", but I am currently studying networking in college.<br>
I'm currently building an app called "Tsuzuku" with @AlooTheAloo that tries to replicate the Apple ecosystem for Windows and Android devices! It's going to be open source and runs on Electron.

Languages I'm comfortable in : C#, Java/Kotlin, Python, C/C++, HTML/CSS, JS, node

Top Projects : Swipe Website Recreation, Kagi (A Windows Activator) and a stupid IP generator<br>

Also follow me on Twitter : @athooow
